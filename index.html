        <div class="subheading mb-5">PsychologyðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a 19 year old African American student. I have previously graduated from John W. North High School in 2018 securing a place in the top 10% of my entire school. I currently attend University of Califonia, Riverside and enrolled in Fall 2018, I am a second-year and my major is psychology. However I am planning to transfer to San Diego State University in Fall 2020. I also commute from Fontana, but attended schools in Riverside since junior high. I have had 3 jobs and been an intern for a non-profit school organization. Immediately after I graduated high school I was recruited to become a referee for volleyball. I had experience and was familiar with the sport and therefore I was able to ref CIF playoffs at high schools and tournaments from 8th grade and up. I worked as a ref throughout the summer of 2018 and my entire first year of college.  .<br><br>

        I then began working at Walmart during the summer of 2019, but quit when my second year of college started because the commute was overwhelming and the hours did not compensate with my college schedule. I then soon after became a caretaker for my family's company and am still employed as one as well. I then became a caretaker for my late grandmother. <br><br>

       In addition, I was also joined and participated in Calpirg a UC wide student organization that advocates for change within our UC system and then branch out to the state of California. They were rsponsible for the plastic bag ban to reduce plastic waste, made a deal with the UC administration to go 100% clean energy by 2035 and made the state of California promise to switch to clean energy by 2040. I have also helped pledge for these social changes and attended their conference this year to discuss which leading social issues we would tackle for the rest of the year.
